<div>: The Content Division element
The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).

The addEventListener() method of the EventTarget interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.
